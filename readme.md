## PointReprojection
Finding all corner points of checkerboard target and visualizing the X and Y axes
### Description
Finding all corner points of a three-dot checkerboard calibration target and
calibrating the camera using One-Shot calibration method. Reprojecting and visualizing
the X and Y axes (defined in world units) in the original image.
### How to Run
Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or
debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main'
function allows debugging step-by-step after 'Engine.OnStarted' event.
Results can be seen in the image viewer on the DevicePage.
To run this sample a device with SICK Algorithm API is necessary.
For example InspectorP or SIM4000 with latest firmware. Alternatively the
Emulator on AppStudio 2.2 or higher can be used. The images can be seen in the
image viewer on the DevicePage.
